# predict-sexual-violence-severity
This project is to understand the relationship between various socio-demographic characteristics, past behavioral patterns, environmental factors and the likelihood of individuals being involved in sexual violence incidents. The goal is to build a predictive model capable of accurately assessing the risk of perpetrating sexual violence.

**Aim**
1. To identify significant factors contributing to sexual violence severity
2. Develop a predictive model integrating conflict characteristics, actor types, and other relevant factors to predict the incidence of sexual violence.
3. Evaluate the model's effectiveness using metrics such as precision and recall to provide valuable insight for policy making in order to reduce sexual violence incident rate.

**Method**
1. Few standard steps and methods are introduced to run the machine learning model.
2. Dataset collection
3. Data preprocessing
4. Exploratory data analysis
5. Machine learning modeling
6. Model evaluation
7. Result interpretation

**Dataset Collection**
The dataset obtained from:
1. www.sexualviolencedata.org.
2. https://wbl.worldbank.org (World Bank: Women, Business and the Law)
3. https://ilostat.ilo.org/data/ (World Bank, World Development Indicators database)
4. https://worldhappiness.report/archive/ (World Happiness Report)

To build a more effective prediction machine learning model, there are some factors that could be considered:
1. Cultural and social factors: social support, freedom to make life choices
2. Psychological and behavioural factors: happiness score
3. Institutional factors: legislation on sexual harassment
4. Environmental factors: GDP per capita, generosity, perceptions of corruption, female to male labour participation ratio
